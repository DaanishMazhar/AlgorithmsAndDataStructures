# AlgorithmsDataStructures
Various Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in Python for learning based purposes

Purpose: To understand data structures and algorithms. Theoretically (with proofs where possible); making sure I outline the space and time complexity's of each. Learning for personal growth, interviews, and on the job.

Main Topics:
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Pythonic Code
- Design Patterns
- System Design

Implementations and concepts completed:
- Understood the concept theoretically with proofs if possible.
- Implemented in Python.
- Pinned down space and time complexity.
